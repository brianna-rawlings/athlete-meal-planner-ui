# Athlete Meal Planner UI (HCI Project)

This is a UI/UX design prototype created for a Human-Computer Interaction class. It’s designed to help athletes plan meals tailored to their goals and streamline grocery shopping.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Athletes often struggle to consistently eat for their goals while staying organized and efficient with groceries. This app bridges that gap with a clean, guided UI.

## 🧪 Features
- Goal-based meal recommendations (Gain Muscle, Lose Fat, etc.)
- Easy-to-navigate meal planner
- Nutritional breakdown per meal
- Auto-generated grocery list by ingredient
- Simple and modern mobile-first UI

## 🎨 Tools Used
- Figma (Prototype and UI design)
- Paper sketches (initial concepting)

## 📝 What I’d Improve Next
- Add meal filtering (e.g. allergies, macros, prep time)
- Consider integrating barcode scanning or online grocery ordering
- Expand to support batch cooking or weekly plans
