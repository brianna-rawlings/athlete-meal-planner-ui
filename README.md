# Athlete Meal Planner UI (HCI Project)

This is a UI/UX design prototype created for a Human-Computer Interaction class. It’s designed to help athletes plan meals tailored to their goals and streamline grocery shopping.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Student athletes can only compete well if they fuel their bodies well. However, proper nutrition requires multiple resources: knowledge, good dining options, time, money, proximity to grocery stores, and proper cookware. 

It is difficult for student athletes to spend time planning what to eat, how much of it, and when to eat it with actual diets because of schedules, workouts, and lack of availability of good resources on college campuses. These obstacles lead to under-fueled athletes who struggle to recover from workouts and are not able to perform to the best of their ability. 

## 🧑‍💻 Target Audience
- College athletes
- Fitness-focused individuals
- Busy professionals with specific nutrition goals

## 🌟 Features
- Select a fitness goal (e.g. Gain Muscle, Lose Fat)
- See goal-aligned meal recommendations
- View nutritional info for each meal
- Automatically generate a grocery list
- Clean, mobile-first UI design

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Figma (for UI and interactive prototype)
- PowerPoint (to document case study and sketches)
- Pen & Paper (for early sketching)

## 📸 Screenshots *(optional, if you export from Figma)*
To see key UI screens at a glance:
- Goal selection screen
- Meal plan browsing
- Individual meal view
- Grocery list generation

## 📝 What I'd Improve Next
- Add filters (diet type, allergens, prep time)
- Sync grocery list to Instacart or store pickup
- Include batch meal prep view and calendar
